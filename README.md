# MediScanner

# What it does ❓
Determines the stage/severity of an injury based on a photo uploaded by the user. The image is compared to a trained ML model that has been fed injury image datasets. A list of treatment recommendations are generated based on the stage of the injury.

# How we built it 🔨
- Front-end was designed and built with React
- API endpoints and request handling was done with Flask
- TensorFlow was used to train and develop the machine learning model
